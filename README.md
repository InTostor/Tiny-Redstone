Tiny Redstone is a forge mod for Minecraft that adds many tiny redstone pieces that you can put together on redstone panels to form tiny redstone circuits.

These panels can be picked up, moved, rotated, and linked with other panels. You can even dye them to match your build!

Each panel can hold up to 64 components in an 8x8 grid. You can choose which sides each piece of Tiny Redstone Dust connects and make your circuits super compact.

## How to play

Craft a Redstone Panel and some tiny redstone components. Right click the panel with the components to place them. Left click with a component or Redstone Wrench in your hand to remove them.
Right click with a Redstone Wrench to rotate the circuit. Break the panel with a pick or your bare hands if you want, and it will retain its components.

### Tiny Redstone ![Tiny Redstone](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/345/698/tiny_redstone.png "Tiny Redstone")

Tiny redstone behaves very much like regular redstone. It picks up signals from strong redstone sources. Signals passed from one tiny redstone to another are decreased by 1. Unlike regular redstone, you can right click to toggle each edge of the redstone on or off. If you click directly in the middle, it will toggle all 4 directions on or off.

### Tiny Repeater

Tiny repeaters are similar to their bigger cousins. They will pick up any redstone signal received at the back and output a full (15) signal to the front with a delay. One major difference is that when you right click the tiny repeater, a GUI will appear allowing you to increase or decrease the tick as much as you'd like to. These ticks represent game ticks. Therefore, 2 ticks = 1 redstone tick. So, if you want the repeater to delay for 1 second, set the ticks to 20.

### Tiny Comparator

Tiny comparators work exactly like regular comparators. They will pick up weak signals from adjacent blocks and inventory comparator outputs when placed on the edge of a panel. You can also right click them to toggle subtract mode, in which case, just like vanilla comparators, the output will be subtracted by the inputs coming in from the sides.

### Tiny Redstone Torch ![Tiny Redstone Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/345/700/tiny_redstone_torch.png "Tiny Redstone Torch")

Similar to regular redstone torches, but cuter. Tiny Redstone Torches can act as redstone power sources and as NOT gates. When placing a Tiny Redstone Torch, it will be point away from you. It will output a full redstone signal on 3 sides, and will switch off when receiving a redstone signal from the bottom side. It is not necessary to place the torch against a block to create a NOT gate, because ... well... they don't really exist.

### Tiny Redstone Block ![Tiny Redstone Block](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/345/702/tiny_redstone_block.png "Tiny Redstone Block")

Like their huge counterpart, Tiny Redstone Blocks output full redstone power in all 4 directions.

### Tiny Piston & Tiny Sticky Piston

Work almost exactly like their monstrous counterpart. Can push up to 12 tiny blocks.
Will not extend if a non-pushable block is in the way.
It will push tiny blocks onto adjacent Redstone Panels but will not push off the panel
if no adjecent Redstone Panel exists.

### Tiny Solid Block

Colorful little wool like blocks. They're not just pretty. They are very useful.
They behave like solid blocks with vanilla redstone. They will carry a weak redstone
signal when powered by redstone, and a strong signal when powered by a repeater or comparator.
And, since they can be pushed by tiny pistons, you can build edge detectors and other powerful circuits.


*Note:* You can not break a Redstone Panel while you are holding a Redstone Wrench or a tiny component. This is to help prevent accidental breakage while removing tiny components from the panel, especially in creative mode.

## Future Plans

- Tiny buttons, levers, redstone lamps, and even pistons!!
- Export/Import circuits to share with friends or use between worlds
- One Probe support, so you can see the redstone signal of each tiny component.
- Several model improvements.
- Sneak right click with wrench to instantly pick up a panel.
- Support for creative player to left click to remove tiny components (currently creatives must sneak-right click with wrench)
- Possible add ons - gates, clocks, redstone math (possibly as an add-on mod since I want to keep this mod vanilla flavored)
- Fixing whatever bugs you find that somehow I didn't find.

## Permissions

Yes, I would love to see this mod in your open source modpack. Curseforge packs are always okay, anywhere else, a link back to this page is appreciated. But you were already doing that for all mods anyway, right?

## Issues and Feature Requests

Please submit bugs and feature requests using the [Issues](https://github.com/dannydjdk/Tiny-Redstone/issues "Nutritional Balance issues") link above.
Be sure to include the mod version, forge version and any relevant crash reports.
This mod is in early beta, and therefore, may has some bugs and minor design issues.
If you do find any problems or have ideas for improvements, I would be most grateful for your input.

## Credits, Acknowledgements and Thanks

Inspiration for this mod comes from many different mods and vanilla Redstone, of course. Probably at the top of the list is Super Circuit Maker. Although there are many differences, I have long since missed being able to create my own compact redstone circuits, and made this mod to fulfill that deep longing.
Thanks also goes to the Forge team and to the many mod authors who came before me.
Without their community contributions, this would not have been possible.
